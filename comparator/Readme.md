** Comparator Circuit **

- Let's compare 3-bit A and B signals using process and if-else structures whenever a clock cycle occurs.
- If A is greater than B, 1-bit C will be '1', 1-bit D '0' and 1-bit EQUAL will be '0'.
- If B is greater than A, C will be '0', D '1' and EQUAL '0'.
- If A and B are equal then C will be '0', D '0' and EQUAL '1'.
- Let's test the design with 10 ns intervals for 6 different situations.
