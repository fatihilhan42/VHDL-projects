**The Design of the Full Adder circuit has been tested for 3 different inputs.**

FULL ADDER Circuit are digital circuits that can add 3 numbers of one bit each.
It consists of 3 inputs, A, B, C. While two of the entries (A) and (B) are number inputs, the third input is (C), ie hand input.
When we examine the diagram, S (sum) Total and Cout (z) are available at the hand, and both show the result of the addition. Here S output gives the sum of A, B, C.
